\section{Motivation}
To test the reliability of a numerical method or an approximation, e.g. such as in \cite{B_bachelor_thesis}, an implementation in python is sufficient. Python is easy to understand and the code can also be used as a base e.g. for a C++ version. A python framework to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a semiclassical approach with \textit{Hagedorn} wavepackets is already availabla on github \cite{waveblocksnd}. This can be used for example to test different propagation schemes, integration methods or integration partitions. In case longer simulations or solving higher dimensional problems is desired the execution time could increase rapidly in a python implementation. Therefore it is necessary to port the python implementation to C or C++ which are highly time efficient. The core implementation is already available in C++ on github \cite{libwaveblocks} but further improvement is desired. This implementation currently uses an external project \cite{eigen3-hdf5} for writing data in HDF5 format. This project is sufficient if the user supervises the generated data. The goal of this project is to use the HDF5 interface \cite{hdf5cppdoc} directly to write data in a comparable way to python. This further allows to implement a data test which can compare data files between python and C++. This was done with the well-known \textit{GoogleTest} \cite{googletest} framework.

\section{Background}
\label{seq:background}

In quantum physics the most prominent problems are governed by the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation \ref{eq:basics_tdse_simple}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:basics_tdse_simple}
  i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Ket{\psi} = H \Ket{\psi}
\end{equation}

where $H$ is the Hamiltonian, $\psi(x,t)$ represents the wave function dependent on position $x$ and
time $t$ and $\langle \psi | \psi  \rangle$ is the probability density of electrons. This can be found in the most basic courses and books about quantum physics. This equation can be reformulated in a semiclassical setting for nuclei as: \
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tdse_sc_nuclei}
 i\hbar \partial_{t}\psi = \left( -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2} \Delta_{x} + V(\vec{x}) \right) \psi\,.
\end{equation}

The goal is to search for $\psi = \psi(\vec{x},t)$ depending on the spatial variables $\vec{x} = (x_{1},\ldots,x_{d}) \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ and the time $t\in \mathbb{R}$. In this context $\Delta_{x}$ is the Laplace operator and $V$ is a smooth real-valued potential $V$, e.g. an electronic energy surface in the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Nevertheless there are still much challenges involved to solve this equation \ref{eq:tdse_sc_nuclei}. One of this is the high dimensionality of this equation. A molecule with $N$ nuclei where each of them has three degrees of freedom results in $3N$ unknowns. For example the simple molecule $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ has already $d=9$ degrees of freedom. Another challenge is the multiple scales governed by the small parameter $\hbar = \varepsilon^{2}$ in case of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ it results in $\hbar \approx 0.0058$. Also the actual solution has frequencies of order $1/\hbar$ which are hard to reproduce for small $\hbar$ on a finite uniform grid as required by a Fourier based approach. Further there is the problem of long time evolutions.\\

An additional method is to use raising and lowering operators for semiclassical wavepackets \cite{H_ladder_operators}. The raising and lowering operators $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ produce a complete $L^2$-orthonormal set of basis functions $\phi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{x}) = \phi_{\vec{k}}^\hbar[\vec{q},\vec{p},\mat{Q},\mat{P}](\vec{x})$ (for multi-indices $\vec{k} = (k_1,\dots,k_d)$ with non-negative integers $k_j$) obeying the three-term recurrence:
\begin{equation*}
          \left(\sqrt{k_{j}+1}\phi_{\vec{k}+\vec{e^j}}\right)_{j=1}^{d}
          = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\hbar}} \mat{Q}\inv \left(\vec{x}-\vec{q}\right) \phi_{\vec{k}} -
          \mat{Q}\inv \conj{\mat{Q}} \left(\sqrt{k_{j}} \phi_{\vec{k}-\vec{e^j}}\right)_{j=1}^{d}
\end{equation*}

Therefore we can have Hagedorn wavepackets of the following form:
        \begin{equation*}
          \begin{split}
            \phi_{\vec{0}}^\hbar & [\vec{q},\vec{p},\mat{Q},\mat{P}](\vec{x})\ =
            (\pi\hbar)^{-\frac{d}{4}} (\det \mat{Q})^{-\frac{1}{2}} \,\times \\
            & \exp\left(\frac{i}{2\hbar} \left(\vec{x}-\vec{q}\right)\T \mat{P}\mat{Q}\inv \left(\vec{x}-\vec{q}\right) +
              \frac{i}{\hbar} \vec{p}\T \left(\vec{x}-\vec{q}\right) \right)
          \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
where $\vec{q}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\vec{p}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ represent the position and momentum, respectively, and $\mat{Q}$ and $\mat{P}$ are complex $d\times d$ matrices satisfying some compatibility relations. For detailed explanation see \cite{FGL_semiclassical_dynamics}. In there is also a basic time propagation algorithm described. Further improvement and proof was presented in \cite{GH_convsemiclassical} about convergence of semiclassical wavepackets based time-splitting.\\

This methods were implemented by Raoul Bourquin as master thesis \cite{B_master_thesis} in python and is available on github \cite{waveblocksnd}. This code can be used in applications e.g tunneling dynamics and spawning \cite{GHJ_tunneling_spawning} or non-adiabatic transition near avoided crossing \cite{BGH_natac}. Until now only the core of this implementation was also already ported to C++. Hagedorn wavepackets was done by Michaja B\"osch \cite{bt_michajab}, inner products and quadrature by Benedek Vartok \cite{st_benedekv} and matrix potentials by Lionel Miserez \cite{bt_lionelm}. This core implementation is available on github \cite{libwaveblocks}. In this project the goal was to enlarge the C++ code functionality with intelligent data serialization. The goal was to reach compatibility between the python and C++ implementation on how data is stored using the \textit{HDF5} interface. This further allowed to use the \textit{GoogleTest} framework to write a data test for the two \textit{HDF5} files. This can be convenient because now we can test if both implementation generate the same data or if there could be a bug in the code.
